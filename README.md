# Lecture-5-
Data Analysis with Pandas

 Libraries : Numpy / pandas / matplotlib.pyplot

 Courses : 
 - Understanding the DataFrame Class
 - Basic Analytics with Pandas
 - GroupBy Operations
 - Complex Selection
 - Concatenation, Joining, and Merging in Financial Data Analysis

 Exercises : 
 1) DataFrame Basics : the opening stock prices / high price of the day and one for the low price of the day
 2) Transforming NumPy arrays to DataFrame : the closing stock prices for seven consecutive trading days / the daily percentage change in closing price / Change in price
 3) Transforming NumPy arrays to DataFrame : volume of trades for five consecutive trading days / average trade size for those days
 4) Working with Dates : one month of trading data for a particular stock / the average trading volume for these days
 5) Analyzing Financial Data : stock closing prices / maximum and minimum closing price / the day with the highest and lowest closing price
 6) Basic Visualization with Pandas : line plot of the closing prices / the closing prices / Highlight the day with the highest closing price
 7) Basic Operations on Series : 10 random stock prices / moving average of these prices over a 3-day window
 8) Applying Aggregate Functions : the average trading volume per day / the day with the highest average trading volume / the total traded value
 9) Complex Selection : the change in volume / Volume Change is greater than 50 and ’Close’ is less than the median closing price
 10)
